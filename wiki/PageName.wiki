= Overview =

Sisrestore or SR is a pack of shell script to provide a deepfreeze like function in linux desktop. It developed specially for Kompudini but it can run on any linux or unix system compatible with small modification or not.

*Any impact to your system is your bussines*

= Installing Sisrestore =

*Recomended* _Before install this script pack you must edit the configuration 
file. Or you can use gui installer without edit configuration file_

Installing this script is simple easy. Execute the setup.sh with "install" 
argument to install it and "uninstall" argument to uninstall it. 
Remember to run it as root (super user).

{{{
example:
	#sh ./setup.sh install
}}}

Or if you use graphical environment, you can use gui based installer instead. 
Use "gui" argument to do it.

*Attention* _GUI mode need zenity and xmessages installed._

{{{
example:
	#sh ./setup.sh gui
}}}
	
Sisrestore is automatically enabled when you install it.

= How it works =

SR provide auto restore to specified directory and the effect is just like deepfreeze in windows environment. SR will "reset" the specified directory to the same state like when you backup the directory. You can choose when SR reset your directory, and there are 3 choices for it. First is when system shutdown, second is when system started and last is on demand by clicking restore button at System Restore GUI Frontend.

Sisrestore mainly use tar to work but it utilize lzma to make compressed backup archive. SR work firstly backup the target with tar. When restore the backup SR use rm -rf to "totally" remove the target and restore the backup later. So dont forget to check your data target before you restore it.

= How to use it =

== 1. Basic usage ==

After install it you can enable SR with this command:

{{{
	#sisrestore enable
}}}
 
With this command you enable Sisrestore to work. 

If you want to disable SR it so easy too :

{{{	
	#sisrestore disable
}}}

This command will deactive all Sisrestore init script and "delete" the backup file.

The SR will work based on wmode (work mode) value in configuration file.
You can call the on demand restore function with this command :

{{{
	#sisrestore restore
}}}

Or you can use SR GUI frontend.
