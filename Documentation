|||  Sisrestore  |||

||  Overview  |
Sisrestore or SR is a pack of shell script to provide a deepfreeze like function in linux desktop.
It developed specially for Kompudini but it can run on any linux or unix system compatible with small
modification or not.
**Any impact to your system is your bussines**

||  Installing Sisrestore  ||

*Recomended* Before install this script pack you must edit the configuration file.

Installing this script is simple easy. Execute the setup.sh with "install" argument to install it and "uninstall" argument to uninstall it. 
Remember to run it as root user.

	example:
	#sh ./setup.sh install

If you use system which use BSD style init like freeBSD, slackware linux etc you have to use additional bsd option to install it and set bsdmod's value in sisrestore.conf from 0 to 1 .

	example:
	#sh ./setup.sh install bsd

Sisrestore is automatically enabled when you install it.

||  How it work  ||

SR provide auto restore to specified directory and the effect is just like if you use deepfreeze in windows environment.
SR will "reset" the specified directory to the same state like when you backup the directory. And you can choose when SR
reset your directory, there are 3 choices. First is when system shutdown, second is when system started and last is on demand
by clicking restore button at System Restore GUI Frontend.

Sistem restore mainly use tar to work but it utilize lzma to make compressed backup archive.
SR work firstly backup the target with tar. When restore the backup SR use rm -rf to "totally" remove the
target and restore the backup later. So dont forget to check your data target before you restore it.

||  How use it  ||

| 1. Basic usage |

After install it you can enable SR with this command:

	#sisrestore enable
 
With this command you enable Sisrestore to work. 

If you want to disable SR it so easy too :
	
	#sisrestore disable

This command will deactive all Sisrestore init script and "delete" the backup file.

The SR will work based on wmode (work mode) value in configuration file. You can call the on demand restore function
with this command :

	#sisrestore restore

Or you can use SR GUI frontend.

| 2. Advance usage |

There are some ugly rule for SR :
1. After change the configuration you must run this command :

	#sisrestore reload
	
2. But if you change the target directory or archive mode You must disable and re-enable SR, so SR make new backup archive.

||  Configuration  ||

You can configure Sisrestore in /etc/sisrestore.conf

There are 3 point which determine SR to work.

| 1. Work mode |

Work mode mean when the SR restore backup file.
There are three work mode :
1. "Work at end" it means SR restore the backup file when you shutdown your computer.
2. "Work at begin" it means SR restore the backup file when you start your computer.
3. "Work on demand" it means SR restore the backup file when you ask SR to restore your archive.

By default SR use wmode 3
Set the value of wmode at configuration file with the work mode number. Example for work at begin mode (mode 2) :

wmode=2

| 2. Archive Mode |

Archive Mode determine the backup file type.
There are two archive mode :
1. Raw TAR for speed but bloat in size
2. LZMA for balance in speed and good in size but long compress time

By default SR use amode 1
Set the value of amode at configuration file with the work mode number. Example for Raw Tar archive backup type (mode 1) :

amode=1

| 3. Target |

Specify your target. Be carefull.

*Attention* Change the mode and target only. Dont touch the other line if you dont know what you do!

||  Trivia  ||



||  BUG  ||

1. It have messy workflow
2. The shortcut to xsr (sr.desktop) only work with gksudo (for gtk/gnome environment). If you use another tool edit the sr.desktop manually or make new shortcut to /usr/sbin/xsr with kdesu or etc.
3. The BSD Mode can't diferentiat work mode 1 and 2. However it will do its job when booting and halt.
