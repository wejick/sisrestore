|||  Sisrestore  |||

||  Overview  |
Sisrestore or SR is a pack of shell script to provide a deepfreeze like 
functionality on linux desktop.
It developed specially for Kompudini but it can run on any linux or unix
system compatible with small or without modification.
**Any impact to your system is your bussines**

||  Installing Sisrestore  ||

*Recomended* Before installing this script pack you must edit the configuration 
file, or you can use gui installer without edit configuration file.

Installing this script is simple and easy. Execute the setup.sh with "install" 
argument to install it and "uninstall" argument to uninstall it. 
Remember to run it as root user.

	example:
	#sh ./setup.sh install

If you use system which use BSD style init like freeBSD, slackware linux 
etc you have to use additional bsd option to install it and set bsdmod's 
value in sisrestore.conf from 0 to 1 .

	example:
	#sh ./setup.sh install bsd

Or if you use graphical environment, you can use gui based installer instead. 
Use "gui" option to do it.

*Attention* GUI mode need zenity installed.

	example
	#sh ./setup.sh gui
	
Sisrestore is automatically enabled when you install it.

||  How it works  ||

Sisrestore provide auto restore functionality to specified directory and the
effect is just like using deepfreeze in windows environment.
Sisrestore will "reset" the specified directory to the same state like when
you backup the directory.
You can choose when Sisrestore reset your directory, there are 3 choices
for it : First is when system shutdown, second is when system started and
the last is on demand by clicking restore button at Sisrestore GUI Frontend.

Sisrestore mainly uses Tar to work but it utilize lzma to make compressed
backup archive.
Sisrestore work by backuping the target with Tar to create an image of 
current directory state. When restoring the backup Sisrestore will totally
remove the target directory with  rm -rf command then restore the backup.
So dont forget to check your data inside target directory before you do restore.

||  How to use it  ||

| 1. Basic usage |

After installing you can enable Sisrestore with this command:

	#sisrestore enable
 
With this command you enable Sisrestore to work. 

If you want to disable Sisrestore it is so easy too :
	
	#sisrestore disable

This command will deactive all Sisrestore init script and "delete" the 
backup file.

Sisrestore will work based on wmode (work mode) value in configuration file.

You can call the on demand restore function with this command :

	#sisrestore restore

All configuration are accesible throug GUI frontend.

| 2. Advance usage |

There are some ugly rule for Sisrestore :
1. After changing the configuration you must run this command :

	#sisrestore reload
	
2. But if you change the target directory or archive mode You must disable
and re-enable SR, so Sisrestore can make new backup archive.

||  Configuration  ||

You can find Sisrestore's configuration file in /etc/sisrestore.conf

There are 3 point which determine Sisrestore to work.

| 1. Work mode |

Work mode determines when Sisrestore restore the backup file.
There are three work mode :
1. "Work at ending" it means Sisrestore restore the backup file when 
you shutdown your computer.
2. "Work at begining" it means Sisrestore restore the backup file when
you start your computer.
3. "Work on demand" it means Sisrestore restore the backup file when
you ask Sisrestore to restore your archive.

By default Sisrestore use wmode 3
Set the value of wmode at configuration file with the work mode number. 
Example for work at begin mode (mode 2) :

wmode=2

| 2. Archive Mode |

Archive Mode determine the backup file type.
There are two archive mode :
1. Raw TAR for speed but bloat in size
2. LZMA for balance in speed and good in size but long compress time

By default Sisrestore use amode 1
Set the value of amode at configuration file with the work mode number.
Example for Raw Tar archive backup type (mode 1) :

amode=1

| 3. Target |

Specify your target directory. Be carefull.

*Attention* Change the mode and target only. Dont touch the other line 
if you dont know what you do!

||  Trivia  ||



||  BUG  ||

1. It have messy workflow
2. The shortcut to xsr (sr.desktop) only work with gksudo (for gtk/gnome
   environment). If you use another tool edit the sr.desktop manually or
   make new shortcut to /usr/sbin/xsr with kdesu or etc.
3. The BSD Mode can't diferentiat work mode 1 and 2. However it will do 
   its job when booting and halt.
